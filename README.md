# Spatial Data Science II, Spring 2024

## Welcome to the Spatial Data Science II course at the University of Minnesota.

## Course Description:

This is the second of a two-course series focused on teaching intermediate skills in spatial data science with emphasis on the Esri ecosystem of geospatial technologies. Students will further develop the skills required to build end-to-end data integration pipelines in the cloud, build automated quality assurance and quality control procedures for data, and run and validate stochastic simulation models. By the end of the course, students will be able to build geospatial workflows and data systems, basic stochastic simulation models, store results and model validation steps in a database, and create professional-level communication maps and graphs.

## Course Objectives:

Build integrated pipelines, APIâ€™s, and data storage systems that leverage cloud and local Esri services

Evaluate and validate spatial models by selecting the correct accuracy assessment metrics for the model and selecting units that are meaningful to model users

Be able to use simulation techniques such as to perform probabilistic spatial analysis at multiple spatial scales from individuals to areal extents

Communicate spatial uncertainty through written and map forms
